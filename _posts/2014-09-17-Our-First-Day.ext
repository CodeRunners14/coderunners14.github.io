The first day at founders and coders was very exciting. We took our positions below a caf√© and met everyone in the team. Being below a coffee shop is fantastic. Coding seems to go hand in hand with caffeine. Working with code can be quite draining on your concentration. A nice jolt of caffeine can be exactly what you need to get you focused on overcoming a problem.
